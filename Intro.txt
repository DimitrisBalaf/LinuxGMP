Intro


LinuxGMP (Graphical Media Player) is a simple pretty distro in Debian 12 with XFCE.

simple full of eyecandy and power, with soon adding 4K HD and Blu-Ray support.


Its goal is to turn your computer into a "Television" with powerful Video/Audio playback capabilities.

I will upload an ISO when most features are properly inserted.
